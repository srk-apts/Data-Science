<h2>18.05 R Tutorial 1B: Random Numbers</h2>

In order to run simulations of experiments with random outcomes we make
use of R's ability to generate random numbers. More precisely it generates 
a 'pseudo-random' number, which behaves in many ways like a truly random
number.


<h3>The function sample(x, k, replace = TRUE)</h3>
<code><pre class="w">
<span class="comment"># sample(x,k) generates a random permutation of k objects from the vector x. That is, all k choices are different</span>

<span class="comment"># start with a vector x with 5 elements.</span>
&gt; x = 1:5
&gt; x
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

<span class="comment"># randomly sample 3 of the elements of x.</span>
&gt; sample(x,3)
[1] 2 5 1
&gt; sample(x,3)
[1] 3 1 4
&gt; sample(x,3)
[1] 1 2 5
<span class="comment"># Note every element is chosen at most once.</span>

<span class="comment"># randomly sampling 5 elements of x is a permutation of all 5 elements.</span>
&gt; sample(x,5)
[1] 1 3 2 5 4
&gt; sample(x,5)
[1] 2 3 1 4 5

<span class="comment"># You can't pick more than 5 <i>different</i> elements from a set of 5 things, so R gives an error.</span>
&gt; sample(x,6)
Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob) : 
  cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'

<b>Allowing repeated elements</b>
<span class="comment"># Sometimes you want to allow repeats. For example when  we roll a die repeatedly we expect to see numbers repeating. We can think of this as picking a random element from a set and then putting it back, i.e. replacing it, so it can be drawn again.

# In R we do this by setting the optional argument replace=TRUE

# Note that we get can get repeated values</span>
&gt; sample(x,3,replace=TRUE)
[1] 3 1 4
&gt; sample(x,3,replace=TRUE)
[1] 4 5 4
&gt; sample(x,3,replace=TRUE)
[1] 2 1 5
&gt; sample(x,5,replace=TRUE)
[1] 5 1 5 1 4
&gt; sample(x,5,replace=TRUE)
[1] 3 5 5 2 1
&gt; sample(x,5,replace=TRUE)
[1] 4 2 3 2 1

<span class="comment"># Now there is no problem asking for more than 5 things from a set of 5 elements.</span>
&gt; sample(x,12,replace=TRUE)
 [1] 1 1 2 1 4 2 3 4 1 2 4 5
&gt; sample(x,12,replace=TRUE)
 [1] 3 2 5 1 4 2 4 1 4 5 3 1

<span class="comment"># To generate an m x n array of random values we can use the function sample function followed by the matrix function.

# Let's simulate rolling a die. 
# We use 1:6 to make vector (1,2,3,4,5,6).

# Generate a 3 x 4 array of random dice rolls.</span>
&gt; y = sample(1:6, 12, replace=TRUE)
&gt; matrix(y,nrow=3,ncol=4)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    6    1
[2,]    2    2    3    6
[3,]    2    1    4    3

<span class="comment"># Or we could make it a 2 x 6 array.</span>
&gt; matrix(y,nrow=2,ncol=6)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    1    2    2    6    4    6
[2,]    2    3    1    3    1    3
</pre></code>

<h3>Simulation</h3>
<code><pre><span class="comment"># First let's simulate rolling 1 die 3 times and checking if one of the rolls was a 6.</span>

<span class="comment"># First we use sample to generate 3 samples from 1:6</span>
&gt; x = sample(1:6,3, replace=TRUE)
&gt; x
[1] 6 4 1

<span class="comment"># To check if any of the 3 rolls are 6 we use the following command. It returns a vector of TRUE or FALSE depending on whether that entry of x is 6 or not. Note the use of the double equal sign. We can't use a single equal sign because that would mean 'set the value of x to 6'. Compare the result with the value of x above.</span>
&gt; x == 6
[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE

<span class="comment">#  We can also see which elements of x are less than 6</span>
&gt; x < 6
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

<span class="comment">#  Now let's roll the die 5000 times and see what fraction of the rolls give 6. We expect that about 1/6 of them will be. </span>

<span class="comment"># Simulate 1000 rolls</span>
&gt; x = sample(1:6,1000, replace=TRUE)

<span class="comment"># x == 6 gives a vector of TRUE or FALSE. R is clever, when we sum the vector: each TRUE counts as 1 and each FALSE counts as 0. So the sum is the number of TRUE's. In this case that means the number of 6's, which happens to be 168. </span>
&gt; sum(x == 6)
[1] 168

<span class="comment"># Divide by 1000 to get the fraction of 6's.</span>
&gt; sum(x == 6)/1000
[1] 0.168

<span class="comment"># Compare that with the theoretical value of 1/6.</span>
&gt; 1/6
[1] 0.1666667
<span class="comment"># Not bad!</span>

<span class="comment"># Now let's estimate the probability of getting at least one 6 in 4 rolls.</span>

<span class="comment"># Goal: estimate the probability of getting at least one 6 in 4 rolls.
# Experiment: roll 1 die 4 times and check for a 6. 
# Repeat the experiment 10 times and see what fraction of times this happens.

# So you can see all the commands at once, we'll show them all and then explain them later. For commenting, we'll put a command number before each '&gt;' </span>

<span class="comment"># Command 1: Generate a 4 by 10 random array. Each column represents one experimental trial of 4 rolls. The 10 columns represent the 10 trials.

# Command 2: Display x

# Command 3: See which of the rolls are 6's. Note the double equals to check which rolls were 6. The result y is an array of TRUE or FALSE. You can check that it picks out the 6's.

# Command 4: Display y

# Command 5: Sum each of the columns. The result is then number of 6's in each
trial (column).

# Command 6: Display z

# Command 7: If the column sum is greater than 0 there was at least one TRUE in the column, that is at least one 6. This command returns a vector of TRUE or FALSE representing  whether or not the experiment yielded a 6.

# command 8: sum the vector in command 7 to get the number of trials that yielded a 6. We see that 5 out of 10 trials did.

# command 9: The mean function is just the sum divided by the number of trials. This is just 5/10 = .5. Half the trials yielded a 10.
 
# Let's repeat this but with 1000 trials instead of 10. Without all the comments it's pretty short.</span>

<span class="comment">Our estimate of the probability of at least one 6 in 4 rolls is .525. This is pretty close to the theoretical value of .518.</span>

<b>The dim() function</b>

<h3>One more simulation</h3>
<pre></code><span class="comment"># Goal: estimate the probability of getting a sum
of 7 when rolling two dice.</span>
1. &gt; ntrials = 10000
2. &gt; x = matrix(sample(1:6, 2*ntrials, replace=TRUE), nrow=2, ncol=ntrials)
3. &gt; y = colSums(x)
4. &gt; mean(y == 7)
[1] 0.1658

<span class="comment"># Command 1: We assign the number of trials to the variable ntrials. Writing code like this makes it easier to modify later. If we want to change the number of trials to 7 we just have to change this one line of code.
# Command 2: we create 10000 columns with 2 rows. That is, we run 10000 experiments of rolling 2 dice.
# Command 3: we sum each of the columns, i.e., we sum the two dice.
# Command 4: we find the fraction of sums that are 7.

# Note, this is essentially the exact answer of 1/6.
