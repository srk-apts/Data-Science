If you have a network with a lot of nodes, then you probably don't want to manually determine the output of each node.  It will take forever.  Instead, you can package the computations up using a more compact notation.  We'll illustrate the ideas with the two-node network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a single input $x$ to a single-layer two-node network.  We can store the weights from each node in a vector $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.  Similarly, we can store the biases from each node in a vector $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.  The affine transformation is then written as $$\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{w}x + \\mathbf{b}$$ where the usual laws of vector addition and multiplication by a scalar apply.  Of course, we have that $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ as well.  Next we evaluate the output from each node.  Formally, we write $$\\mathbf{h} = \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{z}\\right)$$ where, once again, $\\mathbf{h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.  Moreover, it is *understood* that $\\sigma$ operates on each individual element of $\\mathbf{z}$ separately.  If we denote each component of $\\mathbf{z}$ by $z_{j}, \\quad j = 1, 2$ then we can write $$h_{j} = \\sigma\\left(z_{j}\\right), \\quad j = 1, 2.$$\n",
